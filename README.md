# Course Page by Siddharth Nema

This project was created as a selection task for KDAG Web Team.

## Technologies Used

The project was built using: \
 React in Typescript\
 TailWind CSS for styling

## Disclaimer

The course content(The Text) for each module does not change as I lacked the actual course content. However, I have tried to section
the course into the common topics studied in Data Analytics.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
